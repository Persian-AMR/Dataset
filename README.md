This repository contains the dataset developed for creating AMRs for Persian based on the Persian AMR annotation guidelines that can be found [here](https://github.com/Persian-AMR/Annotation-Guidelines). This dataset is based on the translation of "The Little Prince" and aims to address the unique syntactic challenges of Persian. The dataset contains 1562 sentences with their AMR annotations.
